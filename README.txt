Project 2: Prediction of Credit Card Fraud
Overview
This project aims to predict credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only a small fraction of transactions being fraudulent.
Tasks/Activities
1. Load the Data: Load the dataset from the provided CSV file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.
3. Data Cleaning: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
5. Train/Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
6. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification. In this project, logistic regression is chosen as the baseline model.
7. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance using techniques such as grid search.
9. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
10. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-world use, if applicable.
Success Metrics
* The accuracy of the model on the test dataset should be > 75%.
* Methods for hyperparameter tuning should be implemented.
* Model validation should be performed to ensure generalization to new data.
